<h1>Assassins</h1>
<p>Assassins is a live action, 24/7 game that features players assigned to “assassinate” other players through the use of plastic spoons. Each player receives a target and is rewarded with a point on the scoreboard for a successful kill. This continues until only one player is left</p>

<h2>I. Basic Gameplay</h2>
<p>These are the regular procedures while the game is running:<p>
<ul>
<li>Try to kill your Target. This is accomplished by stabbing them with a plastic spoon. The Assassin must be in control of the spoon, no throwing. Kills don’t count if there are Witnesses!</li>
<li>Try not to get killed. You are being targeted by someone else, so stay with Witnesses, or in safe zones. Watch out for people trying to get you alone.</li>
<li>Once you kill your target, obtain their “kill code”, and submit it with their name to the Game Director. A short poetic description of the assassination is always welcome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Participants & Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assassins: These players are given a specific Target to assassinate, and earn kills by eliminating other competitors.</li>
<li>Witnesses: Players may report (to the Game Director) having witnessed an assassination if they see a direct weapon being used on a player during a kill. A Witness is any person who has line of sight of the direct kill occurring. A witness is any person who is “reasonably close”; you should be virtually alone with the target, NOT to rely on people momentarily "not looking", which can be subject to debate.  Witnessed kills do not count. Players can be Witnesses even if they are stunned at the time.</li>
<li>Dead Players: Dead players are out of the game; however they may still assist active Assassins and serve as witnesses. Dead Players should refrain from disclosing information such as who killed them to others, as this is not in the spirit of the game.</li>
<li>Ghosts: Ghosts consist of a revolving group of volunteers under the assignment of the Game Director to eliminate Assassins who break rules or do not make kills in a timely manner. Similar to Assassins, Ghosts will receive tips from the Game Director on their targets. Stunning a Ghost only has a 5 minute cooldown, instead of the normal 24 hour period (see section 4).</li>
<li>Game Director: The Game Director assigns each Assassin their Target and periodically disseminates information about each Target to the Assassin. The Game Director reserves the right to remove players from the game if/when necessary. (Game Director may not act as a Witness or a Ghost).</li>
</ul>

<h2>III. Safety</h2>
<ul>
<li>As this game does involve some level of physical activity, there are a number of safety precautions. While chasing is allowed, please attempt to not do this on stairs or terrain where you might fall and hurt yourself.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to attack someone who is doing something that might hurt them or yourself.</li>
<li>Do not attack above the neck.</li>
<li>Use good judgement</li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do have crazy fun.</li>
<li>Do be paranoid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>IV. How to Kill</h2>
<h3>Killing Others:</h3>
<p>Plastic spoons are the only weapon which may be used to assassinate your own target. You may only assassinate the single target assigned to you. If the scoopy end of your spoon makes direct contact with your victim, they are immediately killed. For safety reasons, all direct hits must be below the neck.</p>
<h3>Protecting Yourself:</h3>
<p>If, and only if, you notice your targeter holding a weapon and making a move to attack you or get near you, then you may “neutralize” your assassin by hitting them according to the kill rules. If you succeed without being hit first, your assailant may not attack for 24 hours. “Ghosts” can also be neutralized, but have a 5 minute attack cooldown, instead of 24 hours.</p>

<h2>V. Scoring + New Targets</h2>
<p>Direct kills should not be witnessed by other people. If they are, the kill does not count. See roles for more information on what a witness is. Each kill counts as a single point, and will be reflected on the public score board next to your alias.</p>

<p>If you make a kill, you should send an email to the director with your target’s kill code. Your new target is the target of the person you just killed. This new target will also be sent to you for confirmation after the kill is registered (see section 8).</p>


<h2>VI. Safe Zones</h2>
<p>Safe zones are areas where attacking is not permitted. Recognized safe zones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside a classroom five minutes before the class is scheduled to begin (Michigan time) to five minutes after class is dismissed</li>
<li>Team provided practice spaces (DTS, IMSB Multipurpose Room, Union/League Ballrooms, etc)</li>
<li>A player’s workplace (not appropriate)</li>
<li>Any vehicles (safety issue)</li>
<li>A players house unless they invite their assailant in (consent)</li>
<li>Any formal event where the game would be inappropriate (comps, a funeral, etc)</li>
<li>Bathrooms are NOT safe zones, but be polite</li>

<p>Areas surrounding practice spaces (CCRB lobby, Union/League hallways) are NOT safe zones.</p>

<h2>VII. Honor System</h2>
<p>This game is based on a lack of witnesses. Please honor the rules and the spirit of the game and die with honor if you have been killed.</p>

<h2>VIII. Kill Codes</h2>
<p>A kill code is a player specific piece of information identifying them within the Assassin network. Every player will submit a short word or phrase as their kill code during final registration. Once a player is killed, the Assassin should obtain the kill code from their target and include it in their message to The Director saying they have succeeded in a kill. The system is designed to expedite kill registration, so please do not lose, share, or forget your kill code.</p>

<h2>IX. Disagreements</h2>
<p>Disputes between players about kills or witnessing a kill should be worked out immediately between players. If players are not able to come to an agreement, the issue must be brought to the attention of the Game Director.</p>
